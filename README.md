# Design patterns tasks

# Description

This dart project implements a builder design pattern example:                                                  
Consists of the User Class in order to create an object that adds to the constructor the data you           
want to provide only.

# Explanation

The **user class** has first name, last name, age, and phone attributes.
The first name and last name are required data.                           

The **user builder class** is used to set the data of the user you need (using setters).                                       
The **buildUser method** (in user builder class) creates a user object using the data set by the user builder.                                             
**Note**:                                                 
if the first name and last name are not set, an exception error will be thrown.
